 - Disable Emojis - this disables the default emoji packages that ship with WordPress, which load on every single page
 of your site and impact performance and speed. This is a tiny tweak that has an incremental benefit.
 - LoadCSS - Removed as caused a number of conflicts with some WP plugins.
 - InstantPage - Removed as causing multiple issues on the sites.
 pages preloading when a user hovers their mouse over links. This does not, in fact increase load times but does appear perception of load times as those few partial
  seconds pre click are actually being used to start loading the next page.
 - DeferJS - Removed as caused a number of conflicts with some WP plugins.
 - Set Browser Cache - Removed as caused a number of conflicts with some WP plugins. (Recommend using CloudFlare or
 similar for better results)
 - Cleanup WordPress meta tags - removes lots of WP native tags included in the header region.
 - Use Excerpts as Meta Description - WordPress automatically takes the first 55 words of a post or page to create an
 excerpt (or you can manually add your own per page/post). This modification uses this excerpt to populate the meta
 description tag. If you have an alternative method of generating this meta tag, you should disable this option.
 - Modified the login page to use the theme design and layout
 - Adds the emergency alert header to the theme customiser

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't this plugin working? =

Please ensure that you have installed and activated the Nightingale theme on your site. If the issue persists, please log an issue.

= Is this plugin restricted to only NHS Organisations =

This plugin has been built specifically for use in the NHS, but it is open source code and you are free to use it on any site.

= My site is doing weird stuff with loading or appearance. Why? =

If you have other plugins running on your site, it is possible they do things that this plugin also does and either
conflicts or duplication is happening. Try disabling options in the plugin to see what is causing the issue.

= Will this give me a perfect LightHouse score? =

No. This improves the performance and accessibility of your site. But your site scores in LightHouse will also be
influenced by your content, your server environment and your other plugins running on your website. We have tested this
with sample content on a site running the Nightingale theme, this plgin and the NHSBlocks plugin. With these parameters,
 we generated a 100 score in LightHouse for the metrics of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.
